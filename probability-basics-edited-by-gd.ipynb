    "# Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we looked at *descriptive* statistics: starting with a dataset and making various observations (overall shape, histogram, outliers, etc.) as well as calculations of quantities that can characterize the dataset as a whole (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the move into inferential statistics, we need to imagine now that *we don't have* (or anyway cannot *measure*) all the data of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is, of course, the typical situation. Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A zoologist wanting to know the typical lifespan of a Siberian tiger\n",
    "- A cosmologist wanting to know the mass of a normal white dwarf star\n",
    "- A businesswoman wanting to know how many M&M's her customers should expect to find in their Party Size bags\n",
    "- A botanist wanting to know how tall California redwoods usually grow\n",
    "\n",
    "The zoologist could, in principle:\n",
    "1. keep track of every currently existing Siberian tiger;\n",
    "2. record their (more or less) exact ages at their moments of death;\n",
    "3. add up those ages and divide by the number of tigers to calculate an average lifespan\n",
    "\n",
    "––But **only** in principle. In all of these situations, there is no realistic or practical opportunity to check each relevant data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do, however, is to check *some* of the data points we want to check. That is, we'll draw a *sample* of data from our *population* of interest. We can then use the techniques of descriptive statistics to characterize our sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this help? The hope, of course, is that our sample will be *representative* of the population as a whole, which would justify our using facts about the sample to ***infer*** things about the population as a whole. But naturally we'll expect a certain amount of **error**: If I take the mean of a sample, $\\bar{x}$ and project it as an estimate of the mean of the whole population, $\\mu$, the estimate is bound to be imperfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics makes all this precise. Some of this gets fairly technical, hence the need for a whole unit on it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick discussion question: How would inferential statistics be relevant to the practicing data scientist?**"

Seeing as I needed only two points to win the game, and you needed 3, I think we can establish that after four more tosses of the coin, the game would have been over. For, in those four tosses, if you did not get the necessary 3 points for your victory, this would imply that I had in fact gained the necessary 2 points for my victory. In a similar manner, if I had not achieved the necessary 2 points for my victory, this would imply that you had in fact achieved at least 3 points and had therefore won the game.
